Subject: [PATCH] KEYS: fix keyctl_set_reqkey_keyring() to not leak thread keyrings

commit c9f838d104fed6f2f61d68164712e3204bf5271b upstream.

This fixes CVE-2017-7472.

Running the following program as an unprivileged user exhausts kernel
memory by leaking thread keyrings:

	#include <keyutils.h>

	int main()
	{
		for (;;)
			keyctl_set_reqkey_keyring(KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_THREAD_KEYRING);
	}

Fix it by only creating a new thread keyring if there wasn't one before.
To make things more consistent, make install_thread_keyring_to_cred()
and install_process_keyring_to_cred() both return 0 if the corresponding
keyring is already present.

Change-Id: I1355f6043290f23132d123c37c2c0fb3b5a7f671
